# omnetppBatmanADV

For community networks research we provide a city-scale simulation model of a BATMAN IV community network. To simulate the network, we first implemented a computer simulation model of BATMAN IV for the OMNeT++ discrete event simulation engine. We then gathered measurements in the real network to parameterize the model and validated its agreement with measurement data based on traces.

Here, we make all simulation models (and their parameterization to resemble the Freifunk network of Paderborn) publicly available as Open Source to serve as a basis for future research on community networks.

If you are using this model (or components from it) in your publications we would appreciate a citation:
